# Copilot instructions - Shader Garden

`AGENTS.md` at the repository root is the authoritative instruction file; follow it. Summary:

- Specification: `docs/DESIGN.md`. Workflow: `docs/ENGINEERING.md`. Shared memory: `docs/AGENT_LOG.md` (read the newest entries first; add an entry at the end of every PR).
- Test-driven development: failing test first, then implementation, then refactor.
- Small stacked PRs on plain GitHub (`stack/<topic>/<nn>-<slug>`), Conventional Commits, never push to `main`.
- Stack: TypeScript, React, Vite, React Three Fiber, GLSL. Check all: `pnpm check`.
- No dependencies outside `docs/DESIGN.md` section 6 without justification; never commit secrets.
